It is organized as a grid:

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: After you upload a video, the transcoding process starts. This can take a while. Depending on the processing power of your instance, it typically takes a multiple of the duration of the uplaoded video. For example, if you uplaod a 1 minute video, transcoding may take 5 minutes. During this time, you videos do not play properly.  
Transcoding is only done once per file right after upload.

Delete unused files to free space.
